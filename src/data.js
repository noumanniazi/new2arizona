    paragraphs: [
      `Some of the highest cost of housing and living in the nation. Some of the highest costs for electricity and fuels in the nation. Unstoppable costs of more regulations, taxes and increased minimum wages targeted toward businesses that are just passed through to the consumers. The frustrating growth of the homeless, poverty, and welfare populations driven by the costs of housing, electricity and fuels. Frustration toward the deteriorating electrical grid that has allowed utilities to turn off power prior to threatening winds to protect themselves from liability lawsuits, producing manmade blackouts. Plus water rationing and other inconveniences are becoming the norm. Growing congestion from the increasing numbers of registered vehicles impacting transportation infrastructures that are not equipped to accommodate it, Getting clobbered by taxes is taking its toll on the psyche and pocketbooks of its residents, along with the high cost of living and doing business. Moreover, since 2008, more than 10,000 businesses have either fled the state or reduced their investments.`
